# EPT_Senegal_Seminar_Presentation_On__Machine_Learning

This Repository keeps tract of files used during a seminar presentation on Machine learning to final year students of the Ecole Polytechnique de Thi√®s (EPT), Senegal

# Part 1

This part gives an introduction on or simple code implementation of machine linearing algorthms.
The implementation was partition into two part(Classification and Regression implentation).
The following algorithms where put to used.

*Classification Algorithm*
* Logistic regression
* KNN
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine

*Regression Algorithm*
* Linear Regression.
* Ridge Regression.
* Lasso Regression.
* Elasticnet.

# Part 2
This part gives a general overview of machine learning implementation, its
follows the data science pipline for the implentation of machin learning algorithms.
In this part, we start from the univariate analysis, bivariate analsis feature engineering down to the modeling aspect
of the problem.
The problem was posed as part of the Microsoft professional programme in data science 2018 for the capstone project.

The Machine learning algorithm used for the implementation was the Catboost algorithm.

# Part 3
This part givs an implementation of the  t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) on the 
MNIST dataset. which is an unsupervised learning algorithm to reduce the dimension of the dataset to two 
components.

# Part 4
This part gives an over and  intuition about over fitting using the wine
quality data.The problem was initially a regression problem but was converted to a classifcation with five classes.
And a decision tree classify was used for the machine learning implementation.

# Part 5
This part gives a general overview on how to automate your machine learning pipeline.
Also we implemented different was of saving and loading your model to be used later using pickle and Joblib
The machine learning algorithm used for the whole process was xgboost..
